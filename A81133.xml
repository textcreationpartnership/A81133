            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>TAke notice, That in this Impression, published <hi>September</hi> the <hi>5<seg rend="sup">th</seg> 1653.</hi> I have made very many Additions to every Sheet in the Book: And also, That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se Books of mine that are printed of that Letter the smal Bibles are printed with, are very falsly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; there being usually twenty or thirty gross mistakes in every Sheet, many of them such as are exceeding dangerous to such as shal venture to use them: And therfore I do hereby warn you of them, I can do no more at present; only take notice of these three Directions by which you shal be sure to know the True one from the False.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first Direction.]</hi> The True one hath this Title over the head of every Page in the Book, <hi>[The English Physitian enlarged:]</hi> The smal Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet one hath only this Title <hi>[The English Physitian.]</hi>

The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet smal one hath these words. <hi>[Vertues and Use]</hi> following the Time of the Plants flowering.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The third Direction.]</hi> The true one is in <hi>Octavo,</hi> of a bigger Letter than the counterfet one, which is in <hi>Twelves,</hi> of the Letter smal Bibles use to be printed on. I shall now speak somthing to the Book it self.</p>
            <p>All other Authors that have written of the Nature of Herbs, gave not a bit of a Reason why such an Herb was appropriated to such a part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor why it cured such a Disease: Truly my own Body being sickly, brought me easily into a capacity, to know that Health was the greatest of all Earthly Blessings, and truly he was never sick that doth not beleeve it. Then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that all Medicines were compounded of Herbs, Roots, Flowers, Seeds, &amp;c. and this first set me awork in studying the Nature of Simples, most of which I knew by sight before; and indeed all the Authors I could reade gave me but little satisfaction in this particular, or none at al: I cannot build my faith upon Authors words, nor beleeve a thing because they say it, and could wish every Body were of my mind in this, To labor to be able to give a reason for every thing they say or do; they say Reason makes a Man differ from a Beast, if that be true, pray what are they that instead of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for their Judgment, quote old Authors? perhaps their Authors knew a Reason for what they wrote, perhaps they did not, what is that to us, do we know it? Truly in writing this Work first, to satisfie my self, I drew out all, the Vertues of vulgar Herbs, Plants, and Trees &amp;c. out of the best, or most approved Authors I had, or could get; and having done so, I set my self to study the Reason of them. I knew well enough, the whol world, and every thing in it, was formed of a Composition of contrary Elements, and in such a Harmony as must needs shew the Wisdom and Power of a great God: I knew as well, this Creation, though thus composed of contraries, was one
<pb facs="tcp:112870:4"/> united Body, and Man an Epitome of it; I knew those various affections in Man in respect of Sickness and Health were caused Naturally (though God may have other ends best known to himself) by the various operations of the Microcosm; and I could not be ignorant, That as the Cause is, so must the Cure be; and therfore he that would know the Reason of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Herbs, must look up as high as the Stars: I alwaies found the Disease vary according to the various motion of the Stars; and this is enough one would think to teach a Man by the Effect where the Cause lay. Then to find out the Reason of the operation of Herbs, Plants, &amp;c. by the Stars went I, and herein I could find but few Authors, but those as full of nonsense and contradictions as an Egg is full of meat; this being little pleasing, and less profitable to me, I consulted with my two Brothers, Dr. <hi>Reason,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Experience,</hi> and took a Voyage to visit my Mother <hi>Nature,</hi> by whose ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice together with the help of Dr. <hi>Diligence,</hi> I at last obtained my desires, and being warned by Mr. <hi>Honesty,</hi> a stranger in our daies, to publish it to the World, I have done it.</p>
            <p>But you will say, <hi>What need I have written of this Subject, seeing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Famous and Learned Men have written so much of it in the English Tongue, nay, much more than I have done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Answer,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> All that have written of Herbs either in the English, or not in the English Tongue, have no waies answered my intents in this Book, for they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed many, nay, very many outlandish Herbs, and very many which are hard, nay, not at all to be gotten, and what harm this may do I am very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of. Once a Student in Physick in <hi>Sussex</hi> sent up to <hi>London</hi> to me, to buy for him such and such Medicines, and send them down, which when I viewed, they were Medicines quoted by Authors living in another Nation, and not to be had in <hi>London</hi> for Love nor Money; so the poor man had spent much pains and brains in studying Medicines for a Disease that were not to be had: so a man reading <hi>Gerrards</hi> or <hi>Parkinsons</hi> Herbal for the Cure of a Disease, he may as like as not, light on an Herb that is not here to be had, or not without great difficulty, if possible; but in mine, all grow neer him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> My last, though not the least of my Reasons is, Neither <hi>Gerrard</hi> nor <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinson,</hi> nor any that ever wrote in the like Nature, ever gave one wise Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for what they wrote, and so did nothing else but train up yong Novices in Physick in the School of Tradition, and teach them just as a Parrot is taught to speak; an Author saith so, ther fore 'tis true; and if all that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors say be true, why do they contradict one another? But in mine, if you view it with the Eye of Reason, you shall see a Reason for every thing that is written, whereby you may find the very Ground and Foundation of Physick; you may know what you do, and wherefore you do it; and this shall call me Father, it being (that I know of) never done in the world before.</p>
            <p>I have now but two things more to write, and then I have done.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1 What the Profit and Benefit of this Work is.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> The Profit and Benefits arising from it, or that may acrue to a wise
<pb facs="tcp:112870:4"/> man from it, are many, so many that should I sum up all the particulars, the Epistle would be as big as the Book; I shall only quote some few general Heads.</p>
            <p>First, The admirable Harmony of the Creation is herein seen, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Stars upon Herbs, and the Body of Man, how one part of the Creation is subservient to another, and all for the use of Man, wherby the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power and Wisdom of God in the Creation appears: and if I do not admire at the simplicity of the Ranters, never trust me; Who but viewing the Creation can hold such a sottish Opinion, as that it was from Eternity, when the Mysteries of it are so cleer to every eye? but that Scripture shall be verified to them, <hi>Rom. 1.20. The invisible things of Him from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World are cleerly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His Eternal Power and Godhead, so that they are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.</hi> And a Poet could teach them a better Lesson:

                     <l>
                        <hi>Excideret ne tibi Divini mune<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>is Author</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Presentem monstrat, quaelibet Herba Deum.</hi>
                     </l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Because out of thy thoughts God should not pass,</l>
                     <l>His Image stamped is on every Grass.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is true, God hath stamped his Image upon every Creature, and therfore the abuse of the Creature is a great sin; but how much more doth the Wisdom and Excellency of God appear if we consider the Harmony of the Creation in the Vertue and Operation of every Herb? This is the First.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hereby thou maiest know what infinite knowledge <hi>Adam</hi> had in his Innocency, that by looking upon a Creature, he was able to give it a name according to his Nature, and by knowing that, thou maiest know how great thy fall was, and be humbled for it even in this respect, because hereby thou art so ignorant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here is the right way for thee to begin the study of Physick if thou art minded to begin at the right end, for here thou hast the Reason of the whole Art. I wrote before in certain Astrological Lectures which I read, and Printed, intituled, <hi>Semeiotica Uranica,</hi> what Planet caused (as a second Cause) every Disease, and how it might be found out what Planet caused it; here thou hast what Planet cures it by <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy;</hi> and this brings me to my last promise, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instructions for the right use of the Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And herein let me premise a word or two, The Herbs, Plants, &amp;c. are now in the Book appropriated to their proper Planets. Therefore,</p>
            <p>First, Consider what Planet causeth the Disease: that thou maiest find in my <hi>Semeiotica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Consider what part of the Body is afflicted by the Disease, and whether it lie in the Flesh, or Bloud, or Bones, or Ventricles.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Consider by what Planet the afflicted part of the Body is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: that my <hi>Semeiotica</hi> wil inform you in also.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You have in this Book the Herbs for Cure appropriated to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Diseases, and the Diseases for your ease set down in the Margin, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:112870:5"/> you may strengthen the part of the Body by its like; as the Brain by Herbs of <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Breast and Liver by Herbs of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Heart and Vitals by Herbs of the <hi>Sun,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You may oppose Diseases by Herbs of the Planet opposite to the Planet that causeth them: as Diseases of <hi>Jupiter</hi> by Herbs of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the contrary; Diseases of the <hi>Luminaries</hi> by Herbs of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; Diseases of <hi>Mars</hi> by Herbs of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the contrary.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, There is a way to cure Diseases somtimes by Sympathy, and so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Planet cures his own Disease, as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> by their Herbs cure the Eyes, <hi>Saturn</hi> the Spleen, <hi>Jupiter</hi> the Liver, <hi>Mars</hi> the Gall and Diseases of Choller, and <hi>Venus</hi> Diseases in the Instruments of Generation.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, There was a smal Treatise of mine of <hi>Humane Vertues,</hi> printed at the latter end of my <hi>Ephemeris</hi> for the year <hi>1651.</hi> I suppose it would do much good to yong Students to peruse that with this Book.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Yong Students would do themselves much good, and benefit themselves exceedingly in the study of Physick, if they would take the pains to view the Vertues of the Herbs, &amp;c. in the Book, and compare them to these Rules, they shal to their exceeding great content find them al agreeable to them, and shal therby see the reason why such an Herb conduceth to the Cure of such a Disease.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, I gave you the Key of al in the Herb <hi>Wormwood,</hi> which if because of the volubility of the Language, any think it wil not fit the Lock, I have given it you again in another Herb of the same Planet in the Book, plainly without any circumstances.</p>
            <p>The Herb is <hi>Carduus Benedictus,</hi> which is in the Alphabetical Order in the Book, to which place I refer you.</p>
            <p>If you please to make use of these Rules, and them at <hi>Carduus,</hi> in the Book, you shal find them true throughout the Book, and by heeding them, you may be able to give a Reason of your Judgment to him that asketh you: I assure you it gave much content to me, and for your goods did I pen it; but I must conclude, my Epistle having exceeded its Bounds already: Hereby you see what Reason may be given for Medicines, and what necessity there is for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Physitian</hi> to be an <hi>Astrologer,</hi> you have heard it before I suppose, but now you know it; what remains, but that you labor to glorifie God in your several places, and do good to your selves first by encreasing your knowledge, and to your Neighbors afterwards by helping their infirmities; some such I hope this Nation is worthy of, and to such shal I remain a Friend: and when the Purchaser may without fear of Theeving Knaves enjoy their just Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in their Copies, I shal not fail to bring forth many more Books for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good in the English Tongue for the benefit of al my Country-men, poor or rich.</p>

               <p>It is of a clensing and cutting faculty without any manifest heat, moderately drying and binding; It openeth and clenseth the Liver, helpeth the Jaundice, and is very beneficial to the Bowels, healing al inward wounds, Bruises, Hurts, and other distempers. The Decoction of the Herb made with Wine and drunk is good against the stinging and biting of Serpents, and helps them that have foul, troubled, or bloody waters, and makes them piss cleer speedily; It also helpeth the Chollick, clenseth the Brest, and rids away the Cough.

                  <hi>Description.]</hi> This hath diverse squar stalks somwhat hairy, at the joynts whereof, grow two sad green Leaves dented about the edges, opposite to one another, the lowermost upon long footstalks, but without any toward the tops which are somwhat round, yet pointed, and a little crumpled and hairy: Round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the upper joynts where the Leavs grow thick, are sundry ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping flowers of a pale reddish color; after which come the Seeds, three or four in a Husk. The Root is smal and thriddy, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing every yeer: the whol Plant hath a strong scent, but not stinking.</p>
               <p>White Arch-angel hath divers square stalks, not standing streight, upright, but bending downward, whereon stand two Leaves at a joynt, larger and more pointed than the other, den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about the edges, and greener also, more like unto Nettle-Leaves, but not stinging, yet hairy: At the joynts with the Leaves stand larger and more open gaping white flowers, in Husks round about the stalks (but not with such a bush of leaves, as flowers set in the top, as is on the other) wherein stand smal roundish black Seeds: The Root is white, with many strings at it, not growing downward, but lying under the upper crust of the Earth, and abideth many yeers encreasing: This hath not so strong a scent as the former.</p>
               <p>Yellow Arch-angel is like the white in the Stalks and Leaves, but that the Stalks are more streight and upright, and the joynts with Leaves are further asunder, having longer Leaves than the former; and the flowers a little larger and more gaping, of a fair yellow color in most, in some paler. The Roots are like the White, only they creep not so much under the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Place.]</hi> They grow almost every where (unless it be in the middle of the street) the Yellow most usually in the wet grounds of woods, and somtimes in the dryer, in divers Countries of this Nation.</p>

               <p>All Authors chop the Vertues of both sorts of Arsmart together, as men chop Herbs for the Pot, when both of them are of clean contrary qualities, The hot Arsmart groweth not so high, or tall, as the mild doth, but hath many leaves of the colour of Peach leaves, very seldom or never spotted, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particulars it is like the former, but may easily be known from it, if you wil be but pleased to break a leaf of it cross your tongue, for the hot wil make your tongue to smart, so wil not the cold; if you see them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you may easily distinguish them, becaus the mild hath far broader leavs: and our Colledg of Physitians out of their learned care for the publick good, <hi>Anglice</hi> their own gain, mistake the one for the other in their <hi>New-Master-Piece,</hi> whereby they discover, 1 Their Ignorance, 2 Their Carelesness, and he that hath but half an eye, may see their pride without a pair of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles.

                  <hi>Government and Vertues.]</hi> 'Tis a Plant under the Dominion of <hi>Mars,</hi> and therefore inimical to Nature. This Herb being drunk, not only provoketh Vomiting,<note place="margin">Causeth Vomiting, Choller, Flegm, Urin, Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Liver and Spleen, Dropsie, Jaundice, Agues.</note> but purgeth downward, and by Urin also, purging both Choller and Flegm: if you ad to it some Spicknard, with the Whey of Goats-milk, or Honyed Water, it is made more strong, but it purgeth Flegm more manifestly than Chollor, and therefore doth much help pains in the Hips and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, it being boyled in Whey, it wonderfully helpeth the Obstructions of the Liver and Spleen, and therefore profitable for the Dropsie and Jaundice being steeped in Wine and drunk. It helps those continual Agues that come by the plenty of stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born humors: an Oyl made thereof by setting it in the Sun, with some Laudanum added to it, provoketh sweating (the ridg of the Back being anointed therewith) and thereby driveth away the shaking fits of the Agues. It wil not abide any long boyling, for it loseth its chiefest strength thereby: nor much beating, for the finer Pouder doth provoke Vomits and Urin, and the courser purgeth downwards.</p>
               <p>The common use hereof, is, to take the Juyce of five or seven Leaves in a little drink to caus Vomitings: the Roots have also the same Vertue, though they do not operate so forcibly, yet they are very effectual against the biting of Serpents,<note place="margin">Serpents, Head, Memory.</note> and therfore is put as an ingredient both into Methridate and Venice Treacle. The Leaves and Roots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boyled in Ly, and the Head often washed therwith, while it is warm, comforteth the Head and Brain that is ill-affected by taking cold, and helpeth the Memory.</p>
               <p>I shal desire Ignorant people to forbear the Use of the Leaves; the Roots purge more gently, and may prove beneficial in such as have Cancers, or old putrified Ulcers, or Fistulaes upon their Bodies, to take a dram of them in Pouder in a quarter of a pint of white Wine in the morning. The truth is, I fancy Purging and Vomiting Medicines as little as any Man breathing doth, for they weaken Nature, nor shal never advise them to be used unless up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on urgent necessity. If a Physitian be Natures Servant, it is his duty to strengthen his Mistris as much as he can, and weaken her as little as may be.</p>

               <p>The red Beet is good to stay the Bloody flux, Womens Courses,<note place="margin">Flux, terms stops, Whites, stinking breath, Noise in the Ears, Smell lost.</note> and the Whites, and to help the yellow Jaundice. The Juyce or the Root put into the Nostrils, purgeth the Head, helpeth the noise in the Ears, and the Tooth-ach; the Juyce snuffed up the Nose helps a stinking breath it the cause lies in the Nose, as many times it doth, if any bruise have been there, as also want of smel coming that way.</p>

               <p>To these I may ad a third sort, which is not so common, nor yet so well known, and therefore I shall give you its Name and Description.</p>
               <p>It is called Langue-de-beef; but why they should call one Herb by the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:112870:32"/> name Bugloss, and another by the name Langue-de-beef, is to me some question, seeing one signifies Ox-tongue in Greek, and the other signifies the same in French.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Description.]</hi> The Leaves thereof are smaller than those of Bugloss, but much rougher, the stalk rising up about a foot and half high, and is most commonly of a red color, the Flowers stand in scaly rough heads, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing composed of many smal yellow Flowers, not much unlike to those of Dandelyon, and the Seed flieth away in Down as that doth: you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily know the Flowers by their tast, for they are very bitter.</p>

The Juyce made into a Syrup prevaileth much to all the purposes aforesaid, and is put with other cooling, opening, clensing Herbs, to open obstructions, and help the yellow Jaundice, and mixed with Fumitory, to cool, clense, and temper the Blood, thereby it helpeth the Itch, Ringworms, and Tetters, or other spreading Scabs or Sores. The flowers Candied, or made into a Conserve are helping in the former causes, but are chiefly used as a Cordial, and is good for those that are weak with long sickness, and to comfort the Heart and Spirits of those that are in a consumption, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with often swoonings, or passions of the Heart: The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled Water is no less effectual to al the purposes aforesaid, and helpeth the redness and inflamation of the Eyes being washed therewith: The dried Herb is never used, but the green; yet the Ashes thereof boyled in Mead, or Honyed Water is available against Inflamations and Ulcers in the Mouth or Throat, to wash and gargle it therewith. The Roots of Bugloss are effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual being made into a licking Electuary, for the Cough, and to condensate thin flegm, and thewmatick distillations upon the Lungues.</p>

The Seed or Leaves taken in Wine is very good against the Plague, and al infectious Diseases, and is very good in Pestilential Feavers. The Juyce put into fresh or green Wounds, doth quickly soder up the Lips of them together, and is very effectual to heal al Ulcers and Sores in the Mouth: The Juyce dropped into the Eyes, taketh away the heat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation in them.

The Decoction of the Root in Wine drunk once a week at going to bed, clenseth the Mother, and helpeth the rising thereof, expelleth the dead Child, and Afterbirth, but is not to be used by Women with Child, for fear of abortion; a dram of the Root in Pouder taken in white Wine bringeth down their Courses. An Electuary made of the Roots and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, doth mightily clense the Chest of rotten Flegm, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully help an old strong Cough, those that are troubled with shortness of Breath, and is very good for them that are bruised inwardly, to help to expel the clotted or congealed Blood. The Leaves, Fruit, and Root, do clense old and filthy sores, are good against al fretting and running Cankers, Gangrenes, and Tet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and therefore the Berries are by some Country People called Tetter-Berries. The Root clenseth the Skin wonderfully from all black and blue spots, freckles, morphew, leprosie, foul scars, or other deformity whatsoever: as also all running scabs, and manginess are healed by the Pouder of the dried Root, or the Juyce thereof, but especially by the fine white hardned Juyce: The distilled water of the Roots worketh the same effects, but more weakly. The Root bruised and applied of it self to any place where the Bones are broken, helpeth to draw them forth, as also splinters and thorns in the flesh; and being applied with a little Wine mixed therewith, it breaketh Boyls, and helpeth whitlows on the Joynts.</p>

               <p>As for the former Diseases, where it must be taken inwardly, it purgeth

The Juyce thereof taken fasting, is held to be of singular good use against the Pestilence: The Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Water with a little Sugar, and a little good Treacle mixed therwith (the party upon the taking being laid down to sweat a little) hath the same effect. The juyce dropped into the Eyes clenseth them from films and cloudiness which darken the sight, but it is best to allay the sharpness of the Juyce with a little Breast-milk: It is good in old filthy corroding, creeping Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers wheresoever, to stay their malignity of fretting and running, and to cause them to heal the more speedily: The Juyce often applied to Tetters, Ringworms, or other such like spreading Cancers, will quickly heal them, and rubbed often upon Warts will take them away. The Herb with the Roots bruised and heated with Oyl of Chamomel, and applied to the Navel, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the griping pain in the Belly and Bowels, and all the pains of the Mother: and applied to Womens Breasts stayeth the overmuch flowing of their Courses.

               <p>OF this I shal briefly describe three kinds, which are principally used in Physick, the Vertues wherof are alike, though somwhat different in their manner and form of growing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Description.]</hi> The <hi>greater Gromel</hi> groweth up with slender hard and hairy stalks trailing and taking Root in the ground as it lyeth theron, and parted into many other smaller branches with hairy dark green leavs theron. At the Joynts with the Leavs come forth very smal blue flowers, and after them hard stony roundish seed. The Root is long and Woody, abiding the winter, and shooting forth fresh stalks in the Spring.</p>
               <p>The <hi>smal wild Gromel</hi> sendeth forth divers upright hard branched stalks two or three foot high, ful of joynts, at every of which groweth smal, long, hard, and rough Leavs like the former but lesser, among which Leavs come forth smal white Flowers, and after them grayish round Seed like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The Root is not very long, but with many strings therat.</p>
               <p>The <hi>garden Gromel</hi> hath divers upright slender woody hairy stalks brown and crested, very little branched, with leavs like the former, and white Flowers, after which in rough brown Husks is contained a white hard round Seed, shining like Pearls, and greater than either of the former: The Root is like the first Described, with divers Branches and Strings thereat; which continueth (as the first doth) al Winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Place.]</hi> The two First grow wild in barren or untilled places, and by the Way sides in many places of this Land. The last is a Nursling in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of the curious.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Government and Vertues.]</hi> The Herb belongs to Dame <hi>Venus,</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>Mars</hi> cause the Chollick or Stone, as usually he doth if in <hi>Virgo:</hi> this is your Cure. These are accounted to be of as singular force as any other Herb or Seed whatsoever,<note place="margin">Stone, Gravel, Strangury, Travail in Women.</note> to break the Stone, and to avoid it and the Gravel either in the Reins or Bladder: as also to provoke Urine being stopped, and to help the Strangury. The Seed is of greatest use, being bruised and boyled in white Wine, or in Broth, or the like, or the Pouder of the Seed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken therin: Two drams of the Seed in Pouder taken with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Breast-milk, is very effectual to procure a speedy Delivery to such Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as have sore pains in their Travel, and cannot be delivered.

He used it also for sore and watering Eyes, and for the Deafness and pain in the Ears, by dropping the Juyce thereof into them, and bathing them afterwards in white Wine. The Decoction thereof made with Water, and a Cock Chicken, is a most safe Medicine against the hot fits of Agues: it also clenseth the Breast and Lungs of Flegm, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle offendeth the Stomach: The Juyce or distilled Water snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up into the nostrils, purgeth the Head and Eyes of Catarrhes and Rhewms.

A Pultiss made hereof with Mallows, and boyled in Wine with Wheat Bran, and Bean Flower, and some Oyl put thereto, and applied Warm to any bruised Sinew, Tendon, or Muscle, doth in a very short time restore them to their strength, taking away the pains of the Bruises; and dissolveth the congealed Blood coming of Blows or Fals from high places.</p>

All the whole Plant, both Leavs, Stalks, and Heads, while they are fresh, yong, and green, yeild a Milk when they are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, of an unpleasant bitter taste, almost ready to provoke casting, and of a strong heady smel, which being condensate, is called</hi> Opium. <hi>The Root is white, and woody, perrishing as soon as it hath given ripe seed.</hi>

                  <hi>The</hi> Black Poppy <hi>little differeth from the former, until it beareth his flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, which is somwhat less, and of a black purplish colour, but without any purple spots in the bottom of the Leaf. The Head of Seed is much less than the former, and openeth it self a little, round about the top, under the crown, so that the seed which is very black, wil fal out if one turn the head thereof downwards.</hi>

The Root perisheth every year, and spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth again of its own sowing. Of this kind, there is one lesser in all the parts thereof, and differeth in nothing else.</hi>

The black seed boyled in Wine and drunk, is said also to stay the Flux of the Belly and Womens Courses. The empty shels of the Poppy-heads are usually boyled in Water and given to procure rest and sleep; so do the Leavs in the same manner: as also if the Head and Temples be bathed with the Decoction warm, or with the Oyl of Poppies, the green Leavs or Heads bruised and applied with a little Vinegar, or made into a Pultis with Barly-meal, or Hogs-grease, it cooleth and tempereth al Inflamations, as also the Disease called St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies Fire.

               <p>The <hi>Wild Poppy,</hi> or Corn Rose (as <hi>Mathiolus</hi> saith) is good to prevent the Falling-sickness. The Syrup made with the Flowers is with good effect given to those that have the Pluresie:<note place="margin">Falling-sickness, Pluresie, Surfets, Agues, and Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> and the dried Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers also, either boyled in Water, or made into Pouder and drunk, either in the Distilled water of them, or in some other Drink, worketh the like effect.

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:112870:116"/> more then these that are full blown, and the White Roses more than the Red. The Decoction of Red Roses made with Wine and used, is very good for the Headach, and pains in the Eyes, Ears, Throat and Gums, as also for the Fundament, the lower bowels, and the Matrix, being bathed, or put into them. The same Decoction with the Roses remaining in it, is profitably applyed to the Region of the Heart to eas the Inflamation therein: as also St. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies fire, and other Diseases of the Stomach.

The dry Conserve which is called Sugar of Roses, is a very good Cordial to strengthen the Heart and Spirits; as also to stay Defluxions. The Syrup of dryed Red Roses streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth a Stomack given to casting, cooleth an overheated Liver, and the Blood in Agues, comforteh the Heart and resisteth putrefaction and infection, and helpeth to stay Lasks and Fluxes. Honey of Roses is much used in Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles and Lotions to wash Sores either in the Mouth, Throat, or other parts, both to clense and heal them, and to stay the Fluxes of Humors falling upon them; it is also used in Clysters both to cool and clense.

Red Rose Water is of wel known and familiar use in al occasions (and better then Damask Rose Water) being cooling and Cordial, freshing quickning the weak &amp; faint spirits, used either in meats, or broths, to wash the Temples, to smel to at the Nose, or to smel the sweet vapors therof out of a perfuming Pot, or cast on a hot Fire-shovel: It is also of much good use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rednesse and Inflamations in the Eyes to bath them therewith; an the Temples of the Head also against pain &amp; ach, for which purpose also Vinegar of Roses is of much good use, and to procure rest and sleep,<note place="margin">Procure sleep.</note> if some thereof and Rosewater together be used to smel unto, or the Nose and Temples moistned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but more usually to moisten a piece of Red Rose Cake cut fit for the purpose, and heated between a double folded Cloth, with a little beaten Nutmeg, and Poppy Seed strewed on the side that must ly next to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Temples, and bound so therto for all night.

Oyl of Roses is not onely used by it salf to cool any hot Swellings or Inflamations, and to binde and stay Fluxes of Humors unto Sores, but is also put into Oyntment and Plaisters that are cooling and binding, and restraining the Flux of Humors. The dryed Leavs of the Red Roses are used both inward and outwardly, both cooling, binding and Cordiall, for with them are made both <hi>Aromaticum Rosarum, Diarhodon Abbatis,</hi>

               <head>Wormwood.</head>
               <p>THree Wormwoods are familiar with us; one I shal, not describe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother I shal describe, and the third be critical at: And I care not greatly if I begin with the last first.</p>
               <p>Sea Wormwood hath gotton as many Names as Vertues (and perhaps one more) <hi>Seriphian, Santonicon, Belgicum, Narbonense, Xantomicum, Misnense,</hi> and a matter of twenty more which I wil not blot Paper withal: A Papist got the Toy by the end, and he called it Holy Wormwood; and in truth I am of Opinion, their giving so much Holiness to Herbs is the reason there remains so little in themselves. The Seed of this Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood is that which usually Women give their Children for the Worms: Of al Wormwoods that grow here, this is the weakest; I but Doctors commend it, and Apothecaries sel it, the one must keep his Credit and the other get Money, and that's the Key of the work. The Herb is good for somthing, because God made nothing in vain: Wil you give me leave to weigh things in the Ballance of Reason? Then thus, The Seeds of the common Wormwood are far more prevalent than the Seed of this to expel worms in Children, or people of ripe age: Of both, some are weak, some are strong. The Seriphian Wormseed is the weakest, and happily may prove to be fittest for weakest Bodies (for it is weak enough in al consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) Let such as are strong take the common Wormseed, for the other wil do but little good. Again, neer the Sea many people live, and <hi>Seriphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> grows neer them, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fore is more fitting for their Bodies, because nourished by the same Air; and this I had from Dr. <hi>Reason.</hi> In whose Body Dr. <hi>Reason</hi> dwels not, dwels Dr. <hi>Madness,</hi> and he brings in his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Dr. <hi>Ignorance,</hi> Dr. <hi>Folly,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sickness,</hi> and these together make way for Dr. <hi>Death,</hi> and the latter end of that man is worse than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Pride was the cause of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; Pride begat a Daughter, I do not know the Father of it unless the Devil, but she Christned it, and cal'd it <hi>Appetite,</hi> and sent her Daughter to tast these Wormwoods, who finding this the least bitter, made the squeamish Wench extol it to the Skies, though the Vertues of it never reached to the middle Region of the Air. Its due praise is this; It is weakest, therfore fitter for weak Bodies, and fitter for those Bodies that dwel neer it, than those that live far from it: my reason is, The Sea (as those that live far from it, know when they come neer it) casteth not such a smel as the Land doth: The tender Mercies of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over al his Works, hath by his eternal Providence planted <hi>Seriphian</hi> by the Sea side, as a fit Medicine for the Bodies of those that live neer it. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It is known to al that know any thing in the Course of Nature, That the Liver delights in sweet things; if so, it abhors bitter; then if your Liver be weak, it is none of the wisest courses to plague it with an Enemy: if the Liver be weak, a Consumption follows; would you know the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? 'tis this, A Mans Flesh is repaired by Blood, by a third Concoction which transmutes Blood into Flesh, ('tis wel I said [Concoction] for if I had said [Boyling] every Cook would have understood me.) The Liver
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:112870:145"/> makes Blood, and if it be weakned that it makes not enough the Flesh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth; and why must Flesh alwaies be renewed? Because the Eternal God when he made the Creation, made one part of it in continual dependancy upon another. And why did he so? Because Himself is only Permanent, to teach us, That we should not fix our affections upon what is Transitory, but upon what endures for ever. The result of al is this, If the Liver be weak and cannot make Blood enough (I would have said [Sanguifie] if I had written only to Scholers.) The <hi>Seriphian</hi> which is the weakest of Wormwoods is better than the best. I have been Critical enough, if not too much.</p>

                  <hi>Place.]</hi> It grows familiarly in <hi>England</hi> by the Sea side.</p>
               <p>Descrip.] <hi>It starts up out of the Earth with many round woody hoary Stalks from one Root, its height is four fo: high, or three at the least. The Leavs in longitude are long, in latitude narrow, in color white, in form hoary, in simililude like Southernwood, only broader and longer, in tast, rather salt than bitter, because it grows so neer the Salt water: At the joynts with the Leavs toward the tops it bears little yellow Flowers. The Root lies deep, and is woody.</hi>

               <p>Common Wormwood I shal not describe, for every Boy that can eat an Egg knows it.</p>
               <p>Roman Wormwood: And why Roman, feeing it grows familiarly in <hi>England?</hi> It may be it was so called because 'tis good for a stinking breath, which the Romans cannot be very free from maintaining so many Baudy Houses by Authority of his Holiness.</p>
               <p>Descript.] <hi>The Stalks are slenderer and shorter than the common Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood by one foot at least; the Leavs are more finely cut and divided than they are, but somthing smaller; both Leavs and Stalks are hoary; the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of a pale yellow color, it is altogether like the common Wormwood, save only in bigness, for 'tis smaller; in tast, for 'tis not so bitter, in smel, for it is spicy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Government and Vertues.]</hi> Wil you give me leave to be Critical a little? I must take leave: Wormwood is an Herb of <hi>Mars,</hi> and if <hi>Pontanus</hi> say otherwise he is beside the Bridg: I prove it thus; What delights in Martial places, is a Martial Herb; but Wormwood delights in Martial places (for about Forges and Iron Works you may gather a Cart load of it) <hi>Ergo</hi> it is a Martial Herb. It is hot and dry in the first Degree,<note place="margin">Choller, venery, provokes Urin, Helps Surfets, Swellings, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite lost, yell. Jaundice,</note> viz. Just as hot as your Blood, and no hotter: It remedies the evils Choller can inflict on the Body of Man by Sympathy. It helps the evils <hi>Venus</hi> and he wanton Girls produce by Antipathy: and it doth somthing else besides, It clenseth the Body of Choller (and who dares say <hi>Mars</hi> doth no good?) It provokes Urine, helps
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:112870:146"/> Surfets, Swellings in the Belly; it causeth an Appetite to meat, because <hi>Mars</hi> rules the attractive faculty in Man: The Sun never shone upon a better Herb for the yellow Jaundice than this is: Why should men cry out so much upon <hi>Mars</hi> for an Infortune (or <hi>Saturn</hi> either?) Did God make Creatures to do the Creation a mischief? This Herb testifies that <hi>Mars</hi> is willing to cure al the Diseases he causes; the truth is, <hi>Mars</hi> loves no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, nor <hi>Saturn</hi> Fools, nor I either. Take of the Flowers of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Rosemary, and Black-Thorn, of each a like quantity, half that quantity of Saffron, boyl this in Renish Wine, but put not in the Saffron til it is almost boyled: This is the way to keep a Mans Body in Health,<note place="margin">Preserve Health, Terms provokes, Biting of Rats and Mice, Mushroms Wheals, Pushes, black and blue Spots, Quinsie, Eyes,</note> appointed by <hi>Camerarius,</hi> in his Book intituled, <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Medicus,</hi> and 'tis a good one too. Besides al this, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood provokes the Terms. I would willingly teach Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and make them Physitians (if I knew how) for they are most fitting for the Calling; if you wil not beleeve me, ask Dr. <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Galen,</hi> a couple of Gentlemen that our Colledg of Physitians keep to vapor with, not to follow. In this one Herb I shal give the Pattern of a Rule to the Sons of Art, rough cast, yet as neer the truth as the men of <hi>Benjamin</hi> could throw a stone; whereby my Brethren of the Society of Astrologers may know by a Penny how a Shilling is coyned: (as for the Colledg of Physitians they are too stately to learn, and too proud to continue: They say a Mouse is under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and that's the reason they feed in the night: The House of the <hi>Moon</hi> is <hi>Cancer;</hi> (Rats are of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Mice, but that they are a little bigger.) <hi>Mars</hi> receives his Fal in <hi>Cancer, Ergo</hi> Wormwood being an Herb of <hi>Mars</hi> is a present Remedy for the biting of Rats and Mice. Mushroms (I cannot give them the title of <hi>Herba, Frutex,</hi> or <hi>Arbor</hi>) are under the Dominion of <hi>Saturn</hi> (and take one time with another they do as much harm as good:) if any have poyson'd himself by eating them, Wormwood an Herb of <hi>Mars</hi> cures him, because <hi>Mars</hi> is exalted in <hi>Capricorn</hi> the House of <hi>Saturn;</hi> and this it doth by Sympathy as it did the other by Antipathy. Wheals Pushes, black and blue spots coming either by Bruises or Beatings, Wormwood an Herb of <hi>Mars</hi> helps, because <hi>Mars</hi> (as bad as you love him, and as il as you hate him) wil not break your Head, but he'l give you a Plaister. If he do but teach you to know your selves, his Courtesie is greater than his Discourtesie. The greatest Antipathy between the Planets, is between <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> one is hot, the other cold; one Diurnal, the other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal; one dry, the other moist; their Houses are opposite; one Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, the other Feminine; one publick, the other private; one is vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, the other effeminate; one loves the light, the other hates it; one loves the field, the other the sheets: then the Throat is under <hi>Venus,</hi> the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie lies in the Throat, and is an Inflamation there: <hi>Venus</hi> rules the Throat (it being under <hi>Taurus</hi> her Sign) <hi>Mars</hi> eradicates al Diseases in the Throat by his Herbs (of which Wormwood is one) and send them to
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:112870:146"/>
                  <hi>Aegypt</hi> on an errand never to return more: this by Antipathy. The Eyes are under the Luminaries; the right Eye of a Man, and the left Eye of a Woman, the <hi>Sun</hi> claims Dominion over: The left Eye of a Man, and the right Eye of a Woman, are the priviledg of the <hi>Moon,</hi> Wormwood an Herb of <hi>Mars</hi> cures hoth; what belongs to the <hi>Sun</hi> by Sympathy, because he is exalted in his House; but what belongs to the <hi>Moon</hi> by Antipathy, becaus he hath his Fal in hers. Suppose a Man be bitten or stung by a Martial Creature, imagin a Wasp, a Hornet, or Scorpion, Wormwood an Herb of <hi>Mars</hi> gives you a present cure:<note place="margin">Biting or stinging by venemous Beeasts.</note> Then <hi>Mars</hi> as Chollerick as he is, hath learned that patience, to pass by your evil speeches of him, and tels you by my Pen, That he gives you no Affliction but he gives you a Cure; you need not run to <hi>Apollo</hi> not <hi>Aesculapius:</hi> and if he were so Chollerick as you make him to be, he would have drawn his Sword for anger to see the il con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of those people that can spy his Vices and not his Vertues. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal God when he made <hi>Mars,</hi> made him for a publick good, and the Sons of Men shal know it in the latter end of the world. <hi>Et saelum Mars solus habet.</hi> You say <hi>Mars</hi> is a Destroyer, mix a little Wormwood an Herb of <hi>Mars</hi> with your Ink, and neither Rats nor Mice wil touch the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is written with it, and then <hi>Mars</hi> is a Preserver. Astrologers say <hi>Mars</hi> causeth Scabs and Itch, and the Virgins are angry with him, because wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>Venus</hi> told them he deforms their Skin: But quoth <hi>Mars,</hi> my only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is, they should know themselves; my Herb Wormwood wil restore them to the Beauty they formerly had, and in that I wil not come an inch behind my opposite <hi>Venus;</hi> for which doth the greatest evil, he that takes away an innate Beauty, and when he hath done, knows how to restore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? or she that teaches a company of wanton Lasses to paint their Faces? If <hi>Mars</hi> be in the Virgin in a Nativity, they say he causes the Chollick, ('tis wel God hath set some body to pul down the pride of Man) He in the Virgin troubles none with the Chollick but them that know not themselves (for who knows himself may easily know al the World) Wormwood an Herb of <hi>Mars</hi> is a present cure for it: and whether it be most like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to love him for his good, or hate him for his evil judg ye. I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most forgotten that Charity thinks no evil: I was once in the Tower and viewed the Wardrobe, and there was a great many fine Cloathes (I can give them no other titie, for I was never neither Linnen or Woollen Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) yet as brave as they looked, my opinion was, the Moaths might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them (yea <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth his Codpiece.) Moaths are under the Dominion of <hi>Mars,</hi> his Herb Wormwood being laid amongst Cloathes wil make a Moath scorn to meddle with the Cloath, as much as a Lyon scorns to meddle with a Mouse, or an Eagle a Fly. You say <hi>Mars</hi> is angry, and 'tis true enough, he is angry with my Country men for being such Fools to be led by the Noses by the Colledg of Physitians as they lead Bears to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Garden. Melancholly Men cannot endure to be wrong'd in point of good name, and that hath sorely troubled old <hi>Saturn,</hi> because they called him the greatest Infortune: In the Body of Man he rules the Spleen, (and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:112870:147"/> that makes Covetous men so Splenetick.) The poor old man lyes crying out of his left side, Father <hi>Saturn</hi>'s angry, <hi>Mars</hi> comes to him, come Brother,<note place="margin">Spleen.</note> I confess thou art evil spoken of, and so am I, thou knowst I have my exaltation in my House, I'l give him an Herb of mine, Wormwood, to cure the poor man; <hi>Saturn</hi> consented, but spoke but little, and so <hi>Mars</hi> cured him by Sympathy. When <hi>Mars</hi> was free from War (for he loves to be fighting, and is the best friend a Soldier hath) I say, when <hi>Mars</hi> was free from War he called a Councel of War in his own Brain to know how he should do poor sinful man good, (desiring to forget his abuses in being called an Infortune) He musters up his own Forces and places them in Battalia, Oh! quoth he, why do I hurt a poor silly Man or Woman? His Angel Answers him, 'Tis because they have offended their God. [Look back to Adam] Well, saies <hi>Mars,</hi> though they speak evil of me, I'l do good to them; Death's cold, my Herb shall heat them, They are full of ill Humors (else they would never have spoken il of me) my Herb shal clense them and dry them: They are poor weak Creatures, my Herb shall strengthen them; they are dull witted, my Herb shall fortifie their Apprehensions; and yet amongst Astrologers, al this doth not deserve a good word; Oh! the Patience of <hi>Mars.</hi>

                     <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> Of Leaves of Herbs, or Trees.</head>
                  <p>OF Leavs, Chuse only such as are green and ful of Juyce, pick them carefully, and cast away such as are any way declining, for they wil putrifie the rest, so shal one handful be worth ten of those you buy in <hi>Cheap side.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Note in what place they most delight to grow in, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them there, for Bettony that grows in the shadow is far better than that which grows in the Sun, because it delights in the shadow: So also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uch Herbs as delight to grow neer the Water let such be gathered as grow neer the Water, though happily you may find some of them upon dry ground: The Treatise wil inform you where every Herb delights to grow.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Leavs of such Herbs as run up to Seed, are not so good when they are in Flower, as before (some few excepted, the Leavs of which are seldom or never used) In such cases, if through ignorance they were not known, or through negligence forgotten, you had better take the top and the Flower than the Leaf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Dry them wel in the Sun, and not in the shadow as the swing of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians is, for if the Sun draw away the Vertues of Herbs, it must needs do the like by Hay by the same Rule, which the Experience of every Country Farmer wil explode for a notable piece of non-sense.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such as are Artists in Astrology (and indeed none else are fit to make Physitians) such I advise, Let the Planet that governs the Herb be Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and the stronger the better; if they can in Herbs of <hi>Saturn,</hi> let <hi>Saturn</hi> be in the Ascendent; in the Herbs of <hi>Mars,</hi> let <hi>Mars</hi> be in the Mid-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for in those Houses they delight; let the <hi>Moon</hi> apply to them by good Aspect, and let her not be in the Houses of their Enemies: if you cannot wel stay til she apply to them, let her apply to a Planet of the same Triplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if you cannot weight that time neither, let her be with a fixed Star of their Nature.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Having wel dryed them, put them up in brown Papers, sewing the Paper up like a Sack, and press them not too hard together, and keep them in a dry place neer the fire.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As for the duration of dryed Herbs, a just time cannot be given, let Authors prate their pleasures: For,</p>
                  <p>First, Such as grow upon dry grounds wil keep better than such as grow on moist.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Such Herbs as are ful of Juyce wil not keep so long as such as are dryer.</p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:112870:149"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, such Herbs as are wel dried will keep longer then such as are ill dried.</p>
                  <p>Yet this I say, by this you may know when they are corrupted, <hi>Viz.</hi> By their loss of colour, or smel, or both, and if they be corrupted, reason will tell you that they must needs corrupt the Bodies of those people that take them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Gather all Leaves in the the hour of that Planet that governs them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THe Flower which is the beauty of the Plant, and of none of the least use in Physick, groweth yearly, and it is to be gathered when it is in its prime.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the time of gathering them, let the Planetary hour, and the Plant they come of, be observed, as we shewed you in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as for the time of the day let it be when the Sun shines upon them that so they may be dry, for if you gather either Flowers when they are wet or dewy, they wil not keep, and this I forgot before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Dry them wel in the Sun, and keep them in Papers near the fire, as I shewed you in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. So long as they retain their colour and smel they are good, either of them being gone so is the Vertue also.</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of Seeds.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe Seed is that part of the Plant which is endued with a vital faculty to bring forth its like, &amp; it contains potentially the whol Plant in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for place let them be gathered from the Plants where they delight to grow.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let them be full ripe when they are gathered, and forget not the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall Harmony before mentioned, for I have found by experience that their Vertues are twice as great at such times than others: There is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time for every thing under the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. when you have gathered them dry them a little, and but a little in the Sun before you lay them up.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You need be so carefull of keeping them so near the fire as the other before mentioned, because they are fuller of Spirit, and therefore not so subject to corrupt.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As for the time of their duration 'tis palpable they wil keep good many years, yet this I say, they are best the first year, and this I make appear by a good Argument, They wil grow soonest the first year they be set, therfore then are they in their prime, and 'tis an easie matter to renew them yearly.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. OF Roots chuse such as are neither rotten nor wormeaten, but proper in their taste, colour, and smel, such as exceed neither in so fine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="383" facs="tcp:112870:149"/>2. Give me leave to be a little critical against the Vulgar received Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is, that the sap falls down into the Root in Autumn, and rises again in Spring, as men go to Bed at night and rise in the morning; and this idle tale of untruth is so grounded in the Heads not onely of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar but also of the Learned, that a man cannot drive it out by reason: I pray let such Sap-mongers answer me to this Argument, If the Sap fall into Root in the fall of the Leaf, and lye there all the Winter, then must the Root grow onely in the Winter, as experience witnesseth, but the Root grows not at all in the Winter, as the same experience teacheth, but onely in the Summer. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you set an apple Kernel in the Spring, you shal find the Root to grow to a pretty bigness in that Summer, and be not a whit bigger next Spring: What doth the Sap do in the Root al that while; pick straws? For God's sake build not your faith upon Tradition, 'tis as rotten as a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Post.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, when the <hi>Sun</hi> declines from the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> the Sap begins to congeal both in Root and branch, when he toucheth the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn</hi> and ascends to us ward, it begins to wax thin again, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees as it congealed: But to proceed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The dryer time you gather your Roots in, the better they are, for they have the less excrementions moisture in them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Such Roots as are soft, your best way is to dry in the Sun, or else hang them in the Chimney corner upon a string; as for such as are hard you may dry them any where.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such Roots as are great will keep longer then such as are small, yet most of them will keep a year.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Such Roots as are soft it is your best way to keep them always near the fire, and take this general Rule for it, If in Winter time you find any of your Roots, Herbs or Flowers begin to grow moist, as many times you shal espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Winter time (for 'tis your best way to look to them once a month) dry them by a very gentle fire, ot if you can with convenience keep them near the fire, you may save your self the labor.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is in vain to dry such Roots as may commonly be had, as Parsly, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, Plantane, &amp;c. but gather them onely for present need.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The Barks of Fruits is to be taken when the Fruit is ful ripe, as Oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Lemmons, &amp;c. but because I have nothing to do with Exoticks here I shal pass them without any more words.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Barks of Trees are best gathered in the Spring, if it be of great Trees, as Oakes or the like, because then they come easiest off, and so you may dry them if you please, but indeed your best way is to gather all Barks only for present use.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for the Bark of Roots, 'tis this, and thus to be gotten, Take the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:112870:150"/> Roots of such Herbs as have a pith in them, as Parsly, Fennel, &amp;c. slit them in the middle, and when you have taken out the pith (which you may easily and quickly do) that which remains is called (though somthing improperly) the Bark and indeed is only to be used.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. JUyces are to be pressed out of Herbs when they are young and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and also out of some Stalks, and tender tops of Herbs and Plants, and also out of some Flowers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Having gathered your Herb you would preserve the Juyce of, when it is very dry (for otherwise your Juyce will not be worth a Button) bruise it very wel in a stone Mortar with a wooden Pestle, then having put it into a Canvas Bag (the Herb I mean, not the Mortar, for that will yeeld but little Juyce) press it hard in a press, then take the Juyce and clarifie it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The manner of clarifying of it is this, put it into a Pipkin or skillet, or some such thing, and set it over the fire, and when the scum riseth, take it off let it stand over the fire till no more Scum rise, then have you your Juyce clarified, cast away the Scum as a thing of no use.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When you have thus clarified it, you have two wayes to preserve it all the year.</p>
                  <p>First, When it is cold put it into a Glass, and put so much Oyl on it as wil cover it the thickness of two fingers, the Oyl wil swim at top, and so keep the Air from coming to it to putrifie it; when you intend to use it, do no more but so, powr out into a Porrenger, a little more then you intend to use, and if any Oyl come out with it (as if the Glass be not ful 'tis a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one if there do) you may easily scum it off with a Spoon, and put the Juyce you use not into the Glass again it wil quickly sink under the Oyl: This is the first way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the second way is a little more difficult, and the Juyce of Fruits is usually preserved this way, when you have clarified the Juyce as before, boil it over the fire, til (being cold) it be of the thickness of Honey, this is most commonly used for Diseases of the Mouth, and is called <hi>Rob</hi> and <hi>Sapa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus much for the first Section, the Second follows.</p>

                  <p>HItherto we have spoken of Medicines which consist in their own Nature, which Authors vulgarly cal Simples, though somthing improperly, for indeed and in truth, nothing is simple but the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:112870:150"/> pure Elements; all things else are compounded of them: We come now to treat of the Artificial Medicines, in the front of which (because we must begin somwhere) we place Distilled Waters; in which consider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Waters are distilled our of Herbs, Flowers, Fruits, and Roots.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We treat not of strong Waters but of cold, as being to Act <hi>Galen</hi>'s Part and not <hi>Paracelsus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Herbs ought to be distilled when they are in their greatest vigor and so ought the Flowers also.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The vulgar way of Distillation which people use, because they know no better, is in a Peuter Still, and although Distilled Waters are the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of al Artificial Medicines, &amp; good for little unless for mixtures of other Medicines, yet this way distilled they are weaker by many degrees than they would be, were they distilled in Sand: If I thought it not impossible to teach you the way of distilling in Sand by writing, I would attempt it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When you have distilled your Water put it into a Glass, &amp; having bound the top of it over with a Paper pricked full of holes, that so the excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and fiery vapors may exhale (which indeed are they that cause that setling in distilled Waters called the Mother, which corrupts the Waters and might this way be prevented) cover it close and keep it for your use.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Stopping distilled Waters with a Cork makes them musty, and so will a Paper also if it do but touch the Water, your best way then is to stop them with a Bladder, being first wet in Water, and bound over the top of the Glass.</p>
                  <p>Such cold Waters as are distilled in a Peuter Still (if well kept) wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a year, such as are distilled in Sand, as they are twice as strong, so wil they endure twice as long.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. A Syrup is a Medicine of a Liquid form, composed of Infusion, Decoction and Juyce: And 1. for the more grateful tast. 2. For the better keeping of it, with a certain quantity of Honey or Sugar; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after mentioned boiled to the thicknesse of new Honey.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You see at the first view that this Aphorisme divides it self into three Branches, which deserves severally to be treated of, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Syrups made by Infusion.</hi>

                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of each of these (for your Instructions sake kind Country men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) I speak a word, or two or three apart.</p>
                  <p>First, Syrups made by Infusion are usually made of Flowers, and of such Flowers, as soon loose both colour and strength by boyling, as Roses Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Peach-Flower-&amp;c. My Translation of the <hi>London Dispensatory</hi> wil instruct you in the rest: They are thus made, having picked your Flowers clean, to every pound of them ad three pound (or three pints, which you will for it is all one) of Spring Water made boyling hot by the fire, first put your Flowers in a Peuter Pot with a cover, then pour the Water to them,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:112870:151"/> then shutting the Pot, let it stand by the fire to keep hot twelve hours, then strain it out (in such Syrups as purge, as Damask Roses, Peach-Flowers, &amp;c. The usuall and indeed the best way is to repeat this Infusion, adding fresh Flowers to the same Liquor diverse times that so it may be the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) having strained it out put the Infusion into a Peuter Bason, or an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then one well glassed, and to every pint of it, ad two pound of fine Sugar, which being only melted over the fire without boiling, and scummed, will produce you the Syrup you desire.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Syrups made by Decoction are usually used of Compounds, yet may any Simple Herb be thus converted into Syrup; Take the Herb, Root or Flower you would make into Syrup and bruise it a little, then boyl it in a convenient quantity of Spring Water, the more water you boyl in it the weaker wil it be, a handful of the Herb, Root, &amp;c. is a convenient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for a pint of Water; boyl it till half the Water be consumed, then let it stand til it be almost cold, and strain it (being almost cold) through a woolen cloath, letting it run out at leisure without pressing, to every pint of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction ad one pound of Sugar and boyl it over the fire til it come to a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, which you may know if you now and then cool a little of it in a Spoon scum it all the while it boyls, and when it is sufficiently boyled: whilst it is hot strain it again through a Woolen cloth, but presse it not; thus have you the Syrup perfected.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Syrups made of Juyces are usually made of such Herbs as are ful of Juyce, and indeed they are better made into a Syrup this way than any other; the Operation is thus, having beaten the Herb in a stone Morter with a wooden Pestle, presse out the Juyce and clarifie it as you were taught before in the Juyces, then let the Juyce boyl away til a quarter of it (or neer upon) be consumed, to a pint of this ad a pound of Sugar, and boyl it to a Syrup, always scumming it, and when it is boyled enough, strain it through a woolen cloath as we taught you before, and keep it for your use.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you make Syrups of Roots that are any thing hard, as Parsley, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and grasse Roots, &amp;c. when you have bruised them, lay them in steep somtime in that Water which you intend to boyl them in, hot, so will the Vertue the better come out.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Keep your Syrups either in Glasses or stone Pots, and stop them not with Cork, nor Bladder, unless you would have the Glass break and the Syrup lost; and as many Opinions as there are in this Nation, I suppose there are but few or none of this, only bind a Paper about the mouth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. All Syrups if well made will continue a year, with some advantage yet of all, such as are made by Infusion keep the least while.</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 3.</hi> Of Juleps.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. JUleps were first invented as I suppose in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and my reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the word <hi>Juleb</hi> is an Arabick word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It signifies only a pleasant Potion, and was vulgarly used (by such as were sick and wanted help, or such as were in health, and wanted no money) to quench thirst.</p>
                  <p n="3">

It is thus made (I mean Simple Juleps, for I have nothing to say to Compounds here; al Compounds have as many several Idea's as men have Crotchets in their Brain) I say Simple Juleps are thus made: Take a pint of such distilled Water as conduceth to the Cure of your distemper, which this Treatise wil plentifully furnish you withal, to which ad two Ounces of Syrup conducing to the same effect (I shal give you Rules for it in the last Chapter) mix them together, and drink a draught of it at your pleasure; If you love tart things, ad ten drops of Oyl of Vitrol to your pint, and shake it together, and it wil have a fine grateful tast.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Al Juleps are made for present use, and therfore it is in vain to speak of their duration.</p>

                     <hi>Chap 4.</hi> Of Decoctions.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. AL the difference between Decoctions, and Syrups made by Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is this, Syrups are made to keep, Decoctions only for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent use; for you can hardly keep a Decoction a week any time, if the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be hot, not half so long.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Decoctions are made of Leavs, Roots, Flowers, Seeds, Fruits, or Barks, conducing to the Cure of the Disease you make them for; in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are they made as we shewed you in Syrups.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Decoctions made with Wine last longer than such as are made with Water, and if you take your Decoction to clense the Passages of Urine, or open Obstructions, your best way is to make it with white Wine instead of Water, because this is most penetrating.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Decoctions are of most use in such Diseases as lie in the Passages of the Body, as the Stomach, Bowels, Kidneys, Passages of Urine, and Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, because Decoctions pass quicker to those places than any other form of Medicines.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If you wil sweeten your Decoction with Sugar, or any Syrup, fit for the occasion you take it for, which is bitter, you may and no harm done.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If in a Decoction you boyl both Roots, Herbs, Flowers, and Seeds together, let the Roots boyl a good while first, because they retain their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue longest; then the next in order by the same Rule, viz. 1. Barks, 2. the Herbs, 3. the Seeds, 4. the Flowers, 5. the Spices if you put any in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their vertues comes soonest out.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Such things as by boyling cause sliminess to a Decoction, as Figs, Quince-seeds, Linseed, &amp;c. your best way is, after you have bruised them, to tie them up in a linnen rag, as you tie up a Calves Brains, and so boyl them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Keep al Decoctions in a Glass close stopped, and in the cooler place you keep them, the longer wil they last ere they be sowr.</p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:112870:152"/>
                  <p>Lastly, The usual Dose to be given at one time, is usually two, three, four, or five ounces, according to the age and strength of the Patient, the season of the year, the strength of the Medicine, and the quality of the Disease.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. OYL Olive, which is commonly known by the name of Sallet Oyl, I suppose because it is usually eaten with Sallets by them that love it; If it be pressed out of ripe Olives, according to <hi>Galen</hi> is temperate, and exceeds in no one quality.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of Oyls, some are Simple, and some are Compounds.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Simple Oyles are such as are made of Fruits or Seeds, by expression, as Oyl of sweet and bitter Almonds, Linseed, and Rapeseed Oyl, &amp;c. of which see my <hi>Dispensatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Compound Oyls are made of Oyl of Olives and other Simples, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Herbs, Flowers, Roots, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The way of making them is this, Having bruised the Herbs or Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers you would make your Oyl of, put them in an earthen pot, and to two or three handfuls of them powr a pint of Oyl, cover the pot with a paper, and set it in the Sun, about a fortnight or less according as the Sun is in hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; then having warmed it very wel by the fire, press out the Herbs, &amp;c. very hard in a press, and ad as many more Herbs to the same Oyl, bruised (the Herbs I mean not the Oyl) in like manner, set them in the Sun as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the oftner you repeat this, the stronger wil your Oyl be; at last when you conceive it strong enough, boyl both Herbs and Oyl together til the Juyce be consumed, which you may know by its leaving its bubling, and the Herbs wil be crisp, then strain it, whilst it is hot, and keep it in a stone or glass Vessel for your use.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As for Chymical Oyls, I have nothing to say in this Treatise.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The General use of these Oyls is for pain in the Limbs, roughness of the skin, the itch, &amp;c. as also for Oyntments and Plaisters.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If you have occasion to use it for Wounds or Ulcers, in two ounces of Oyl, dissolve half an once of Turpentine, the heat of the fire wil quickly do it, for Oyl it self is offensive to Wounds, and the Turpentine quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it.</p>

                  <p>PHysitians makes more a quoil then needs behalf about Electuaries: I shal prescribe but one general way of making them up; as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients you may vary them as you please, and according as you find occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by the last Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That you may make Electuaries when you need them, it is requisite that you keep alwayes Herbs, Roots, Seeds, Flowers, &amp;c. ready dried in your House, that so you may be in readiness to beat them into pouder when you need them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your better way is to keep them whole than beaten, for being beaten
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:112870:152"/> they are the more subject to lose their strength, because the Air soon pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If they be not dry enough to beat into Pouder when you need them, dry them by a gentle fire til they are so.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Having beaten them, sift them through a fine Tiffany Searce, that so there may be no great pieces found in your Electuary.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 To one ounce of your Pouder, ad three ounces of clarified Honey; this quantity I hold to be sufficient: I confess Authors differ about it. If you would make more or less Electuary, vary your proportions accordingly.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Mix them wel together in a Mortar, and take this for a truth, You cannot mix them too much.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The way to clarifie Honey, is to set it over the fire in a convenient vessel til the scum arise, and when the scum is taken off, it is clarified.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 The usual dose of Cordial Electuaries, is from half a dram to two drams; of Purging Electuaries, from half an ounce to an ounce.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 The manner of keeping them is in a Pot.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 The time of taking them, is either in the morning fasting, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting an hour after them; or at night going to bed, three or four hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Supper.</p>

                     <hi>Chap. 7.</hi> Of Conserves.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THe way of making Conserves is Two-fold, one of Herbs and Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and the other of Fruits.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conserves of Herbs and Flowers are thus made: If you make your Conserves of Herbs, as of Scurvy-grass, Wormwood, Rue, or the like take only the Leaves and tender tops (for you may beat your heart out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you can beat the Stalks smal) and having beaten them, weigh them-and to every pound of them ad three pound of Sugar, beat them very wel, together in a Mortar, you cannot beat them too much.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conserves of Fruits, as of Barberries, Sloes, and the like, is thus made: First scald the Fruit, then rub the Pulp through a thick hair Sieve made for the purpose, called a Pulping Sieve; you may do it for a need with the back of a Spoon, then take this Pulp thus drawn, and ad to it its weight of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and no more, put it in a Peuter Vessel, and over a Charcoal fire stir it up and down til the Sugar be melted, and your Conserve is made.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thus have you the way of making Conserves; the way of keeping of them, is in Eatrhen Pots.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Dose is usually the quantity of a Nutmeg at a time morning and evening, or (unless they be purging) when you please.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Of Conserves, some keep many yeers, as Conserves of Roses; others but a yeer, as Conserves of Borrage, Bugloss, Cowslips, and the like.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Have a care of the working of some Conserves presently after they are made, look to them once a day, and stir them about; Conserves of Borrage, Bugloss, and Wormwood have gotten an excellent faculty at that sport.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. You may know when your Conserves are almost spoiled by this, You shal find a hard crust at top with little holes in it, as though Worms had been eating there.</p>

                  <p>OF Preserves are sundry sorts, and the Operations of al being som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different we wil handle them al apart.</p>
                  <p>There are preserved with Sugar,
<list>
                        <item>1 <hi>Flowers.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2 <hi>Fruits,</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3 <hi>Roots.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4 <hi>Barks.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Flowers are but very seldom preserved, I never saw any that I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, save only Cowslip Flowers, and that was a great fashion in <hi>Sussex</hi> when I was a Boy: It is thus done, first, Take a flat Glass, we cal them Jar Glasses, strew in a lain of fine Sugar, on that a lain of Flowers, on that another lain of Sugar, on that another lain of Flowers, do so til your Glass be ful; then tie it over with a Paper, and in a little time you shal have very excellent and pleasant Preserves.</p>
                  <p>There is another way of Preserving Flowers, namely with Vinegar and Salt, as they pickle Capers and Broom Buds, but because I have little skil in it my self I cannot teach you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Fruits, as Quinces and the like, are preserved two waies.</p>
                  <p>First, Boyl them wel in Water, and then pulp them through a Sieve as we shewed you before; then with the like quantity of Sugar boyl the Water they were boyled in to a Syrup, viz. A pound of Suga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to a pint of Liquor; to every pound of this Syrup ad four ounces of the Pulp, then boyl it with a very gentle fire to the right consistence, which you may easily know if you drop a drop of it upon a Trencher, if it be enough it wil not stick to your fingers when it is cold.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another way to preserve Fruits is this: First, pare off the rind, then cut them in halves and take out the Core; then boyl them in Water til they are soft, if you know when Beef is boyled enough, you may easily know when they are; then boyl the Water with its like weight of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar into a Syrup, put the Syrup into a Pot, and put the boyled Fruit as whol as you left it when you cut it into it, and let it so remain til you have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to use it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Roots are thus preserved: First, scrape them very clean, and clense them from the Pith if they have any, for some Roots have not, as Eringo and the like; boyl them in Water til they be soft, as we shew you before in the Fruits, then boyl the Water you boyled the Roots in into a Syrup as we shewed you before, then keep the Root: whol in the Syrup til you use them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for Barks we have but few come to our hands to be done, and those of those few that I can remember, are Orranges, Lemmons, Citrons, and the outer Bark of Walnuts which grows without the Shel, for the Shels themselves would make but scurvy Preserves: these be they I can remember, if there be any more put them into the Number.</p>
                  <p>The way of preserving these is not al one in Authors, for some are bitter, some are not; such as are bitter, say Authors, must be soaked in warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:112870:153"/> often times changed til their bitter tast be fled; but I like not this way, and my reason is this, because I dout when their bitterness is gone, so is the Vertue also: I shal then prescribe one common way, namely the same with the former, viz First boyl them whol til they be soft, then make a Syrup with Sugar and the Liquor you boyled them in, and keep the Barks in the Syrup.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are kept in Glasses, or glassed Pots.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The preserved Flowers wil keep a year if you can forbear eating of them; the Roots and Barks much longer.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t was plainly and cleerly at first invented for delicacy, yet came afterwards to be of excellent use in Physick: For,</p>
                  <p>First, Hereby Medicines are made pleasant for sick and queazy Stomachs, which else would loath them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Hereby they are preserved from decaying a long time.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Their first invention was, to prevent and remedy afflictions of the Breast and Lungs, to clense the Lungs of flegm, and make it fit to be cast out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They are in Body thicker than a Syrup, and not so thick as an Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The manner of taking them, is often to take a little with a Liquoris stick, and let it go down at leisure.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 They are easily thus made: Make a Decoction of any Pectoral Herbs, the Treatise wil furnish you with enough, and when you have strained it, with twice its weight of Honey or Sugar, boyl it to a Lohoch: If you are molested with tough flegm, Honey is better than Sugar, and if you ad a little Vinegar to it you wil do wel, if not, I hold Sugar to be better than Honey.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 It is kept in Pots, and may be kept a yeer and longer.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Its use is excellent for roughness of the Windpipe, Inflamations of the Lungs, Ulcers in the Lungs, difficulty of Breath, Asthmaes, Coughs and distillation of Humors.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 VArious are the waies of making Oyntments which Authors have left to posterity, which I shal omit, and quote one which is easiest to be made, and therfore most beneficial to people that are ignorant in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, for whose sakes I write this: It is thus done,</p>
                  <p>Bruise those Herbs, Flowers, or Roots you would make an Oyntment of, and to two handfuls of your bruised Herbs ad a pound of Hogs Greas tried, or clensed from the Skins, beat them very wel together in a stone Mortar with a wooden Pestle, then put it in a stone Pot (the Herbs and Grease I
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:112870:154"/> mean, not the Mortar) cover it with a paper, and set it either in the Sun, or some other warm place, three, four, or five daies, that it may melt; then take it out and boyl it a little, then whilst it is hot, strain it out, pressing it out very hard in a Press, to this Grease ad as many more Herbs bruised as before, let them stand in like manner as long, then boyl them as you did the former; if you think your Oyntment be not strong enough you may do it the third and fourth time; yet this I tel you, the fuller of Juyce your Herbs are, the sooner wil your Oyntment be strong: the last time you boyl it, boyl it so long til your Herbs be crisp and the Juyce consumed, then strain it, pressing it hard in a Press, and to every pound of Oyntment ad two ounces of Turpentine, and as much Wax, because Grease is offensive to Wounds as wel as Oyl.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Oyntments are vulgarly known to be kept in Pots, and wil last above a yeer, above two yeer.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 THe Greeks made their Plaisters of divers Simples, and put Mettals in most of them, if not in al; for having reduced their Mettals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pouder, they mixed them with that fatty substance whereof the rest of the Plaister consisted, whilst it was yet hot, continually stirring it up and down lest it should sink to the bottom; so they continually stirred it til it was stiff; then they made it up in Rols, which when they need for use they could melt by the fire again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Arabians made up theirs with Meals, Oyl, and Fat, which needed not so long boyling.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Greeks Emplaisters consisted of these Ingredients: Mettals, Stones, divers sorts of Earth, Feces, Juyces, Liquoris, Seeds, Roots, Herbs, Excrements of Creatures, Wax, Rozin, Gums.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 PUltisses are those kind of things which the Latins call <hi>Cataplasma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and our learned Fellows, that if they can read English that's all, cal them <hi>Cataplasms,</hi> because 'tis a crabbed word few understand; it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very fine kind of Medicine to ripen Sores.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They are made of Herbs and Roots fitted to the Disease and Member afflicted, being chopped smal and boyled in Water almost to a Jelly, then by adding a little Barley Meal, or Meal of Lupines, and a little Oyl, or rough Sheep Suet, which I hold to be better, spread upon a cloath and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the grieved place.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Their use is to ease pains, to break Sores, to cool Inflamations, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve hardness, to ease the Spleen, to concoct Humors, to dissipate swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 I beseech you take this Caution along with you, Use no Pultisses (if you can help it) that are of a heating Nature, before you have first clensed the Body, because they are subject to draw the Humors to them from every part of the Body.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 THe Latins cal them <hi>Placentulae,</hi> or little Cakes (and you might have seen what the Greeks cal them too, had not the last Edition of my <hi>London Dispensatory</hi> been so hellishly printed; that's al the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth get by one Stationers printing anothers Copies, viz.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; they are usually little, round, flat Cakes, or you may make them square if you wil.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Their first invention was, that Pouders being so kept might resist the intromission of Air, and so endure pure the longer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Besides, They are the easier carried in the pockets of such as travel: Many a man (for example) is forced to travel whose Stomach is too cold, or at least not so hot as it should be, which is most proper, for the Stomach is never cold til a man be dead; in such a case 'tis better to carry Troches of Wormwood, or of Galanga, in a paper in his pocket, and more convenient behalf than to lug a Galli-pot along with him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 They are thus made: At night when you go to bed, Take two drams of fine Gum Tragacanth, put it into a Galli-pot, and put half a quarter of a pint of any distilled Water fitting the purpose you would make your Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for, to it, cover it, and the next morning you shal find it in such Gelly as Physitians cal Mussilage; with this you may (with a little pains taking) make any Pouder into Past, and that Past into little Cakes called Troches.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Having made them, dry them wel in the shadow, and keep them in a Pot for your use.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 THey are called <hi>Pilulae,</hi> because they resemble little Bals; the Greeks cal them <hi>Catapotia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is the Opinion of Modern Physitians, That this way of making up Medicines, was invented only to deceive the Pallat, that so by swallowing them down whol, the bitterness of the Medicine might not be perceived, or at least it might not be unsufferable; and indeed most of their Pils, though not al, are very bitter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 I am of a clean contrary Opinion to this: I rather think they were done up in this hard form, that so they might be the longer in digesting, and my Opinion is grounded upon Reason too, not upon Fancy nor Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say. The first invention of Pils was to purge the Head: now as I told you before, such imfirmities as lay neer the passages were best removed by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, because they pass to the grieved part soonest; so here, If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity lie in the Head or any other remote part, the best way is to use Pils, because they are longer in digestion, and therfore the better able to cal the offending Humor to them.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 The way to make Pils is very easie, for with the help of a Pestle and Morter, and a little diligence, you may make any Pouder into Pils, either with Syrup or the Jelly I told you of before.</p>

                  <p>First, to the Vulgar: Kind Souls, I am sorry it hath been your hard mishap to have been so long trained in such Egyptian darkness, even dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which to your sorrows may be felt: The vulgar Road of Physick is not my Practice, and I am therfore the more unfit to give you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and I have now pulished a little<note n="*" place="margin">Galen's Art of Physick.</note> Book which wil ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instruct you, not only in the knowledg of your own Bodies, but also in fit Medicines to remedy each part of it when affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; mean season take these few Rules to stay your Stomachs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 With the Disease, regard the Cause, and Part of the Body afflicted: for example, Suppose a Woman be subject to miscarry through Wind, thus do,
<list>
                        <item>1 Look <hi>[Abortion]</hi> in the Table of Diseases, and you shal be directed by that how many Herbs prevent Miscarriage.</item>

                  <p>These are the Herbs Medicinal for your G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ief.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In al Diseases strengthen the part of the Body afflicted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In mixed Diseases there lies some difficulty, for somtimes two parts of the Body are afflicted with contrary Humors the one to the other; som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one part is afflicted with two contrary Humors, as somtimes the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is afflicted with Choller and Water, as when a man hath both a Dropsie and the yellow Jaundice, and this is usually mortal.</p>
                  <p>In the former, suppose the Brain be too cold and moist, and the Liver too hot and dry, thus do,
<list>
                        <item>1 Keep your Head outwardly warm.</item>
                        <item>2 Accustom your self to smel of hot Herbs.</item>
                        <item>3 Take a Pil that heats the Head at night going to Bed.</item>
                        <item>4 In the morning take a Decoction that cools the Liver, for that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passeth the Stomach, and is at the Liver immediately.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>You must not think (Courteous People) that I can spend time to give you examples of al Diseases; these are enough to let you see so much light as you without Art are able to receive: If I should set you to look upon the Sun I should dazle your Eyes, and make you blind.</p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:112870:155"/>
                  <p>Secondly, To such as study Astrology (who are the only men I know that are fit to study Physick, Physick without Astrology, being like a Lamp without Oyl) You are the Men I exceedingly respect, and such Documents as my Brain can give you at present (being absent from my study) I shal give you, and an Example to shew the proof of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Fortifie the Body with Herbs of the Nature of the lord of the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, 'tis no matter whether he be a Fortune or an Infortune in this case.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 Let your Medicin be somthing of the Nature of the Sign ascending.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 If the lord of the Tenth be strong, make use of his Medicines.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 If this cannot wel be, make use of the Medicines of the light of time.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Be sure alwaies fortifie the grieved part of the Body by Sympathetical Remedies.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Regard the Heart, keep that upon the Wheels because the Sun is the Fountain of Life, and therefore those universal Remedies <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> and the Phylosophers Stone, cure al Diseases by only fortifying the Heart.</p>
                  <p>But that this may appear unto you as cleer as the Sun when he is upon the Meridian, I here quote you an example, which I performed when I was as far off from my Study as I am now, yet am I not ashamed the World should see how much or little of my Lesson I have learned without Book.</p>

                           <hi>Prognostica.]</hi> Whether she wil be Curable or not, or how, or when the Disease wil End, is our next Point? Truly I can see no danger of Death, the <hi>Moon</hi> being strong in her Hain, and applying by Trine with a strong recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lady of the Ascendent; yet this is certain, <hi>Mars</hi> strong in a fixed sign wil maintain the Disease stoutly, her hopes wil be but smal when <hi>Venus</hi> comes to the Body of <hi>Saturn, viz. August. 2.</hi> for she wil be overpressed with Melancholly, the time I suppose of her Cure may be (if good courses be taken) when <hi>Mars</hi> leavs the Sign he is in, and comes to the place where the Body of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is, or at least then it may turn to another Disease more propitious: the <hi>Sun</hi> strong in the Tenth shews she may be Cured by Medicine, and he being exalted in the Seventh, and caput there, I do not know but you are as likely a man to do it, as any.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Indicationes Curativae.]</hi> It is confessed here that the Sun being exceeding strong in the tenth House, should naturally signifie the curative Medicine, and as true that the evill of <hi>Mars, viz.</hi> Heat of the Womb, and a salt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in the bloud ought to be removed before you meddle with the tough Flegm in the Breast, but yet seeing the Disease seems rather to participate of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heat than any other Simple quality, you must have a care of hot Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines lest you go about <hi>ignem olea extinguere,</hi> the Medicines must first be cool, Secondly, strengthening the Womb, Thirdly, repressing the vapors, Fourthly, of the nature of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Therapeutice.]</hi> To this intent I first commend unto you stinking Arrach, a patern whereof I have sent you here inclosed, you may find it upon Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:112870:157"/> especially such as are made of Hors-dung: It is cold and moist, an Herb of <hi>Venus</hi> in the Scorpion; also <hi>Ros Solis</hi> an Herb of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Coelestial Crab, may do very wel, and the better because <hi>Venus</hi> is in <hi>Cancer:</hi> It grows upon bogs in untilled places, and is in flower about this time: It grows very low, with roundish green Leavs full of red hairs, and is fullest of dew when the Sun is hotest, whence it took its name; to these you may ad Tansie, which I take to be an Herb of <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Libra,</hi> and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice if you please which is an Herb of the <hi>Moon, Mars</hi> having his fall in <hi>Cancer</hi> they are all harmlesse, you may use them according to your own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: also Orpine, another Herb of the <hi>Moon</hi> is very good in this case.</p>
                        <p>Sir, I wish you wel, and if you esteem of my Lark above his deserts, I pray trim his Feathers from him (correct the Errors by the Errata) else will he make but unpleasing musick. Thus remains yours, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>I the rather chose this Figure to judg of, because none should have just occasion to say of us Astrologers that we do as Physitians vulgar practice is, when they judg of Piss; pump what they can out of the Querent, and then judg by his words; of which I will rehears you one merry story, and so I will conclude the Book.</p>
                        <p>A Woman whose Husband had bruised himself, took his water and away to the Doctor trots she; the Doctor takes the Water and shakes it about, <hi>How long hath this party been ill</hi> (saith he) Sr. saith the Woman, <hi>He</hi> hath been ill these two dayes, This is a mans water quoth the Doctor presently, this he learned by the word <hi>HE;</hi> then looking on the water he spied bloud in it, the man hath had a bruise saith he, I indeed saith the Woman, my Husband fell down a pair of stairs backwards, then the Doctor knew wel enough that what came first to danger must needs be his back and shoulders, said, the bruise lay there; the woman she admired at the Doctors skill, and told him, that if he could tel her one thing more she would account him the ablest Physitian in <hi>Europe;</hi> wel, what was that? How many stairs her Husband fell down this was a hard Question indeed, able to puzle a stronger Brain than Mr. Doctor had, to pumping goes he, and having taken the Urinell and given it a shake or two, enquires whereabout she lived, and knowing wel the place, and that the Houses thereabouts were but low built Houses, made answer (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another view of the Urine for fashions sake) that probably he might fall down seven or eight stairs, ah, quoth the woman, now I see you know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, my Husband fell down thirty; thirty I quoth the Doctor, and snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching up the Ʋrinell, is here all the Water saith he? no saith the Woman, I spilt some of it in putting of it in, look you there quoth Mr. Doctor, there were all the other stairs spilt.</p>
                        <p>Yet mistake me not, I do not deny but such whose daily experience is to judg waters, and usually judg a hundred in a day may know somthing by them: If any thing may be known by Urine, I am sure it may by Art, put them both together, <hi>vis unita fortior.</hi> Thus I take my leave of you; be diligent and I am yours.</p>
